def generate_video_filename(markdown_filename: str) -> str:
    """
    Generate video filename with timestamp handling.

    Detects and replaces timestamps in both formats:
    - Bracketed: [YYMMDD_HHMMSS] → Replaced with [current_timestamp]
    - Unbracketed: YYMMDD_HHMMSS (as suffix) → Replaced with current_timestamp (no brackets)

    If no timestamp exists, appends current timestamp (no brackets) as suffix.

    Args:
        markdown_filename: Original markdown filename (with or without .md extension)

    Returns:
        Video filename with .mp4 extension and updated/added timestamp

    Examples:
        >>> generate_video_filename("video_[250118_143022].md")
        "video_[250118_150530].mp4"  # bracketed timestamp replaced with bracketed

        >>> generate_video_filename("frame0145-260101_220134.md")
        "frame0145-260108_150530.mp4"  # unbracketed timestamp replaced with unbracketed

        >>> generate_video_filename("my_video.md")
        "my_video_260108_150530.mp4"  # timestamp added as suffix (no brackets)
